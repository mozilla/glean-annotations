The results panel remains open when these engagement types occur: dismiss, inaccurate_location, not_interested, not_relevant, show_less_frequently\n  Of those types, not only does the panel stay open, the suggestion also remains present for the following: inaccurate_location, show_less_frequently\n  That means it's possible for more than one engagement to occur with a suggestion while the panel remains open. e.g., `inaccurate_location` followed by `click`, or `show_less_frequently` followed by `not_interested`.\n  For all other engagement types not listed above, the results panel closes.\n\n**Question 2:** What is the difference between `selected_result='addon'` and `selected_result='addon_experimental'`? Why is `addon_experimenntal` a valid value for `selected_result`, but not in the `results` string?\n\n**Answer 2:** `addon`: Used for extensions that use the [omnibox WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/omnibox). There are a number of these out in the wild, so this value will show up in the data occasionally.\n  `experimental_addon`: Used for extensions created by the Firefox Search Engineering Team using the experimental urlbar WebExtensions API. We don\u2019t actually use this API anymore or create extensions with it. It\u2019s how we used to implement experiments several years ago. No plans to start using it again. Should not appear in the data.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the difference between `suggest_sponsor` vs (`merino_adm_sponsored` + `rs_adm_sponsored`)?\n\n**Answer 3:** `suggest_sponsor` is on Firefox 113 and earlier and includes sponsored suggestions from both Merino and remote settings. In 114, `suggest_sponsor` was replaced with `merino_adm_sponsored` and `rs_adm_sponsored`, which break out the suggestion source, either Merino or remote settings.\n\n**Question 4:** What is the difference between `suggest_non_sponsor` vs (`merino_wikipedia` + `rs_adm_nonsponsored`)?\n\n**Answer 4:** `suggest_non_sponsor` is on Firefox 113 and earlier and includes non-sponsored suggestions (a.k.a. \"expanded Wikipedia\") from both Merino and remote settings. In 114, `suggest_non_sponsor` was replaced with `merino_adm_nonsponsored` and `rs_adm_nonsponsored`. In all cases, \"non-sponsored\" means expanded Wikipedia.\n  `merino_wikipedia` is dynamic Wikipedia. There is no `rs_` version because by their nature these suggestions are provided only by Merino.\n\n**Question 5:** What does `merino_top_picks` mean?\n\n**Answer 5:** In Firefox 114+, it refers to navigational suggestions.\n\n**Question 6:** How do we identify Dynamic Wikipedia suggestions?\n\n**Answer 6:** Dynamic Wikipedia was recorded as `dynamic_wikipedia` in 113, which is the version that the dynamic Wikipedia experiment targeted. In 114 and later, it's recorded as `merino_wikipedia`. \n\n**Question 7:** How does the search session end for each `engagement_type` value?\n\n**Answer 7:**\n- For `click`, `enter`, `go_button`: the user has selected one of the results displayed in the panel. The panel closes and the selected result page loads.\n- For `drop_go`, `paste_go`: the user has dropped or pasted text into the URLbar\n  and immediately navigated to it (either a URL, or a SERP if the text was interpreted as a search query). The results panel did not open and no results were shown. The `selected_result` type is `input_field`.\n- For `help`: the user has selected \"Learn More\" from the meatball menu next to one of the results displayed in the panel. The panel closes and a support page loads.\n- For `dismiss`,  `not_interested`, `not_relevant`: the user has selected an option from the meatball menu next to one of the results displayed in the panel. The panel stays open. The affected result is removed from the panel, but the current search string and other results remain in view. The search session has not ended.\n- For `inaccurate_location`, `show_less_frequently`: the user has selected an option from the meatball menu next to one of the results displayed in the panel. The panel stays open, and the current search string and all results remain in view. The search session has not ended."}}, "pings": {"fog-validation": {"commentary": "Analyses for this ping include:\n* Validating that FOG is behaving well\n  in [bug 1651110](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651110)\n* Validating that Glean client_ids behave similarly to Firefox Telemetry client_ids\n  in [bug 1678146](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1678146)"}, "messaging-system": {"commentary": "The following is a detailed overview of the different kinds of data we collect\nin the Messaging System and the New Tab Page.\n\n# Messaging System pings\n\nThese pings record impressions and user interactions for messages served by the\nMessaging System.\n\n## Moments page pings\n\nThis records when a moments page message has set the user preference for\n`browser.startup.homepage_override.once`.

in Feature Callouts are handled by the\nOnboarding pings above, but since Feature Callouts are inserted into other\ncontent, they have some additional capabilities.\n\n### Page event ping for Feature Callouts\n\nFeature Callout messages can include properties to listen for specific events on\nthe host page and perform an action when fired. For example, Feature Callouts\npointing to a button can be dismissed when that button is clicked. This metric\nrecords the event type, event target, and action.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"experiments\": {},\n  \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n  \"version\": \"107.0a1\",\n  \"release_channel\": \"default\",\n  \"event\": \"PAGE_EVENT\",\n  \"event_context\": {\n    \"action\": \"DISMISS\",\n    \"reason\": \"CLICK\",\n    \"source\": \"button.primary#some-button\",\n    \"page\": \"about:firefoxview\"\n  },\n  \"message_id\": \"FIREFOX_VIEW_TAB_PICKUP_REMINDER\",\n  \"addon_version\": \"20221013100028\",\n  \"client_id\": \"26288a14-5cc4-d14f-ae0a-bb01ef45be9c\",\n  \"browser_session_id\": \"e7e52665-7db3-f348-9918-e93160eb2ef3\"\n}\n```\n\n### Feature Callout dismissal\n\nA Feature Callout can be dismissed by clicking its dismiss button directly or\npressing the Escape key. With a page event listener, it can also be configured\nto dismiss the callout when an event in the page happens, such as clicking the\ntarget of the callout (see the page event ping above).\n\n```js\n{\n  \"experiments\": {},\n  \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n  \"version\": \"108.0a1\",\n  \"release_channel\": \"default\",\n  \"event\": \"DISMISS\",\n  \"event_context\": {\n    \"source\": [\n      \"dismiss_button\",\n      \"KEY_Escape\",\n      \"PAGE_EVENT:button.primary#some-button\"\n    ],\n    \"page\": [\"about:firefoxview\", \"chrome://browser/content/browser.xhtml\"]\n  },\n  \"message_id\": \"some_feature_callout_id\",\n  \"addon_version\": \"20221013100028\",\n  \"client_id\": \"26288a14-5cc4-d14f-ae0a-bb01ef45be9c\",\n  \"browser_session_id\": \"e7e52665-7db3-f348-9918-e93160eb2ef3\"\n}\n```\n\n## Nimbus messaging experiment pings\n\nAll Firefox Messaging System experiments are deployed via Nimbus, including the\nfirst-run experience (about:welcome), Spotlights, Feature Callouts, and Moments\npages.\n\n### Enrollment & Unenrollment pings\n\nUnder the hood, Nimbus makes use of the Normandy API for experiment management.\nTherefore, the enrollment and unenrollment pings are collected through the\nNormandy counterparts. See the\n[`normandy`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml#764)\ntelemetry event category for more details.\n\n### Experiment reach ping\n\nThis records whether a branch's targeting and trigger are satisfied for\nMessaging System experiments. The branch slug will be recorded in the\n`extra_keys` property, and the event `value` will be the experiment slug.\n\nWhen the specified trigger fires, targeting will be evaluated for each branch,\nand each qualified message _other than_ the active branch will be recorded in\nthis way.\n\nThis can be used to measure the reach of a trigger + targeting combination\nwithout actually showing a message\n([see here](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/understanding-the-reach-of-our-triggers-fx112release-part-1/summary) for example).\nTo measure the reach of targeting without considering the reach of the trigger,\nuse the `messagesLoaded` trigger, which fires as soon as messages are loaded and\ntherefore has nearly 100% reach.\n\nUnlike other Messaging System pings, this is a legacy Firefox telemetry event,\nand it is sent only for users enrolled in a Messaging System experiment.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"category\": \"messaging_experiments\",\n  \"method\": \"reach\",\n  // message group: [\"cfr\", \"cfr-experiments\", \"eco\", \"import-spotlights\", \"micro-surveys\", \"moments-pages\"]\n  \"object\": \"cfr\"\n  \"value\": \"experiment_slug\",\n  \"extra_keys\": {\n    \"branches\": \"branch_slug\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Experiment attribute errors\n\nThis records whether issues were encountered with any of the targeting\nattributes used in the experiment enrollment or message targeting. Two different\ntypes of events are sent: `attribute_error` and `attribute_timeout` along with\nthe attribute that caused it. An attribute is a variable inside the JEXL\ntargeting expression that is evaluated client side by the browser.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"messaging_experiments\",\n  \"targeting\",\n  \"attribute_error\", // event\n  \"foo\", // attribute,\n  \"extra_keys\": {\n    \"source\": \"message id or experiment slug\",\n  },\n},\n{\n  \"messaging_experiments\",\n  \"targeting\",\n  \"attribute_timeout\", // event\n  \"bar\", // attribute,\n  \"extra_keys\": {\n    \"source\": \"message id or experiment slug\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\n# New Tab Page pings\n\nThese pings are related to the New Tab Page. Although the New Tab Page is\ndistinct from the Messaging System, it shares some code and telemetry structure.\n\n## New Tab Page user event pings\n\nThese pings are captured when a user **performs some kind of interaction** in\nthe New Tab Page.\n\n### Basic shape\n\nA user event ping includes some basic metadata (tab id, addon version, etc.) as\nwell as variable fields which indicate the location and action of the event.\n\n```js\n{\n  // This indicates the type of interaction\n  \"event\": [\n    \"CLICK\",\n    \"SEARCH\",\n    \"BLOCK\",\n    \"DELETE\",\n    \"IMPRESSION\",\n

pings\n\nWhen a session ends, the browser will send a `\"activity_stream_session\"` ping to our metrics servers. This ping contains the length of the session, a unique reason for why the session ended, and some additional metadata.\n\n### Basic event\n\nAll `\"activity_stream_session\"` pings have the following basic shape. Some fields are variable.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"action\": \"activity_stream_session\",\n  \"client_id\": \"26288a14-5cc4-d14f-ae0a-bb01ef45be9c\",\n  \"session_id\": \"005deed0-e3e4-4c02-a041-17405fd703f6\",\n  \"addon_version\": \"20180710100040\",\n  \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n  \"page\": [\"about:newtab\" | \"about:home\" | \"about:welcome\" | \"unknown\"],\n  \"session_duration\": 4199,\n  \"profile_creation_date\": 14786,\n  \"experiments\": {\n    \"experiment_1\": { \"branch\": \"control\" },\n    \"experiment_2\": { \"branch\": \"treatment\" }\n  },\n  \"user_prefs\": 7\n}\n```\n\n### What causes a session end?\n\nHere are different scenarios that cause a session end event to be sent:\n\n1. After a search\n2. Clicking on something that causes navigation (top site, highlight, etc.)\n3. Closing the browser\n4. Refreshing\n5. Navigating to a new URL via the url bar or file menu\n\n### Session performance data\n\nThis data is held in a child object of the `activity_stream_session` event called `perf`. All fields suffixed by `_ts` are type `DOMHighResTimeStamp` (aka a double of milliseconds, with a 5 microsecond precision) with 0 being the [timeOrigin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin) of the browser's hidden chrome window.\n\nAn example might look like this:\n\n```js\nperf: {\n  // Timestamp of the action perceived by the user to trigger the load\n  // of this page.\n  //\n  // Not required at least for error cases where the\n  // observer event doesn't fire\n  \"load_trigger_ts\": 1,\n\n  // What was the perceived trigger of the load action:\n  \"load_trigger_type\": [\n    \"first_window_opened\" | // home only\n    \"menu_plus_or_keyboard\" | // newtab only\n    \"unexpected\" // sessions lacking actual start times\n  ],\n\n  // when the page itself receives an event that document.visibilityStat=visible\n  \"visibility_event_rcvd_ts\": 2,\n\n  // When did the topsites element finish painting?
