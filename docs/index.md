# Glean annotations

This repository stores user-defined annotations against product metrics at Mozilla defined using the [Glean SDK]: both those defined in applications (for example, "fenix" aka "Firefox for Android") as well as libraries like [android-components].

These annotations are published as an API at this site: [api.json](api.json).

For information on how to contribute annotations, see [contributing](./contributing/index.md).
