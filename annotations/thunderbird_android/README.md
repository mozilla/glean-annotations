If you consent, Thunderbird for Android sends usage information to Mozilla to understand how it is being used. For example, how many accounts are set up on average. Personally identifiable information such as your email content is never shared with us. We further gather technical information about your device. Given the Android variety, this also helps us determine where to focus optimizations. 

We keep this information for the default retention period of 400 days. Some probes may be collected for a shorter period as indicated below.

Sharing this information is important, as it guides our decision on which features to remove or improve. We genuinely want to better understand what users care about and appreciate your willingness to free the inbox.
