There are two types of tabs that show up in the recent tabs section on the Fenix home screen:
tabs that have media in progress and recently used tabs.
A user can choose to open one of those tabs, or can choose to see a list with all opened tabs.
This metric is used to collect info about how many users are choosing to open that list from the recent tabs section.
