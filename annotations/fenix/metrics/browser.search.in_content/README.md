Around the mid January 2021 for Nightly/Beta and end January 2021 for Release, telemetry was implemented for Google topsite tile. 

This implementation leads to the increase in both the `tagged_sap` and `tagged_follow_on` and drop in `organic` in the `mobile_search_clients_daily` (hence all tables based on it). You can see [here](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/79738/source#198048) the increase in `tagged_rate`.
