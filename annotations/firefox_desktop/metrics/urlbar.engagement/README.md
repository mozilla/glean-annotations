Question: When an engagement event is sent, regardless of engagement_type, does the urlbar menu of results collapse so that the user has to start over in a new search?
Answer: It depends on the engagement. The results panel remains open when these engagement types occur: dismiss, inaccurate_location, not_interested, not_relevant, show_less_frequently

Of those types, not only does the panel stay open, the suggestion also remains present for the following: inaccurate_location, show_less_frequently

That means it's possible for more than one engagement to occur with a suggestion while the panel remains open. e.g., `inaccurate_location` followed by `click`, or `show_less_frequently` followed by `not_interested`.

For all other engagement types not listed above, the results panel closes.
