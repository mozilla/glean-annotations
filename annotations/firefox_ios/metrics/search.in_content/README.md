Around Feb 2021, telemetry was implemented for Google topsite tile on iOS. 

This implementation leads to the increase in both the `tagged_sap` and `tagged_follow_on` and drop in `organic` in the `mobile_search_clients_daily` (hence all tables based on it). 

Dashboard will be added later since currently work to show this implementatio in `bigquery-etl` is still in progress.
