See [here](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/77816/#193601) for an example of a query that uses this probe to estimate the number of new Firefox for iOS profiles that are opened as default over time. The query uses the baseline ping to calculate the number of daily new profiles, and left joins onto a count of profiles that have a non-0 (true) value for `app.opened_as_default_browser`.

Note again that this probe will NOT reflect users who DO have Firefox for iOS set as default but only open the app directly on a given day (that is, do not open it via an external link). This means that the numbers reflected in the query above should be treated as a lower bound (i.e. an undercount) on the number of new profiles setting the browser to default on a given day.
