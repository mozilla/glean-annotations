This is best used as an indication of how often a client opens new a new tab and not how many tabs that are open.
This is due to the fact that this metric only counts the number of tabs _opened_ by the user during the current 
metrics ping time window, it doesn't account for any tabs that may have already been open prior to the beginning 
of the metrics ping window.
